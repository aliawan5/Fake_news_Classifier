# Fake_news_Classifier
A fake news classifier is a machine learning model designed to detect and classify news articles or social media posts as either true or false (fake). The goal is to automatically identify and filter out misinformation, which can be harmful and misleading.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Remove noise from the text, such as HTML tags, special characters, and URLs.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Remove common words that do not carry significant meaning (e.g., "the," "and").
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form to normalize the text.

then use the tesorflow in which i used the embedding layer and LSTM to train the model
